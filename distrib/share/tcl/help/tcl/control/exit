NAME
       exit - End the application

SYNOPSIS
       exit ?returnCode?


DESCRIPTION
       Terminate  the  process, returning returnCode to the system as the exit
       status.  If returnCode isn't specified then it defaults to 0.

EXAMPLE
       Since non-zero exit codes are usually interpreted as error cases by the
       calling  process,  the  exit command is an important part of signalling
       that something fatal has gone wrong.  This code fragment is  useful  in
       scripts to act as a general problem trap:
              proc main {} {
                  # ... put the real main code in here ...
              }

              if {[catch {main} msg]} {
                  puts stderr "unexpected script error: $msg"
                  if {[info exist env(DEBUG)]} {
                      puts stderr "---- BEGIN TRACE ----"
                      puts stderr $errorInfo
                      puts stderr "---- END TRACE ----"
                  }

                  # Reserve code 1 for "expected" error exits...
                  exit 2
              }
