NAME
       concat - Join lists together

SYNOPSIS
       concat ?arg arg ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This  command  joins  each  of its arguments together with spaces after
       trimming leading and trailing white-space from each of  them.   If  all
       the arguments are lists, this has the same effect as concatenating them
       into a single list.  It permits any number of arguments; if no args are
       supplied, the result is an empty string.

EXAMPLES
       Although concat will concatenate lists (so the command:
              concat a b {c d e} {f {g h}}
       will  return  "a b c d e f {g h}" as its result), it will also concate-
       nate things that are not lists, and hence the command:
              concat " a b {c   " d "  e} f"
       will return "a b {c d e} f" as its result.

       Note that the concatenation does not remove spaces from the  middle  of
       its arguments, so the command:
              concat "a   b   c" { d e f }
       will  return  "a    b   c d e f" (i.e. with three spaces between the a,
       the b and the c).
