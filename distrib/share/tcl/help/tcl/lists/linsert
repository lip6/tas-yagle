NAME
       linsert - Insert elements into a list

SYNOPSIS
       linsert list index element ?element element ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This command produces a new list from list by inserting all of the ele-
       ment arguments just before the index'th element of list.  Each  element
       argument  will  become a separate element of the new list.  If index is
       less than or equal to zero, then the new elements are inserted  at  the
       beginning of the list.  If index has the value end, or if it is greater
       than or equal to the number of elements in the list, then the new  ele-
       ments are appended to the list.  end-integer refers to the last element
       in the list minus the specified integer offset.

EXAMPLE
       Putting some values into a list, first indexing from the start and then
       indexing from the end, and then chaining them together:
              set oldList {the fox jumps over the dog}
              set midList [linsert $oldList 1 quick]
              set newList [linsert $midList end-1 lazy]
              # The old lists still exist though...
              set newerList [linsert [linsert $oldList end-1 quick] 1 lazy]
