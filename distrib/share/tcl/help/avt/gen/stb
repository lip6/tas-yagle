       Launches  the  static  timing  analysis,  based  upon  SDC and INF con-
       straints.
           The analysis can be  tuned  with  configuration  variables  through
       _a_v_t___C_o_n_f_i_g _(_).
           The function returns a stability figure, which is a mapping of sta-
       bilty information (switching windows) on the timing figure.
