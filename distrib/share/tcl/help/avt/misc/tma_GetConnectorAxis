       Returns the defined connector axis set for a connector/signal.
           If no axis have been defined for the signal or the signal does  not
       exist, the returned list contains only one element with value _-_1.
           There is an exeption if the signal is an internal clock and no axis
       is defined for it. In  this  case,  the  slope  max  of  the  clock  is
       returned.
