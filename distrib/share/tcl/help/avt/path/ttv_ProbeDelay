       Retreives the paths by specifying a list of nodes on the paths  without
       the  need  for  intermediate  nodes  to  be  forcibly  path  stop nodes
       (latches, precharges, connectors, ...).
           The type of the crossed nodes can be specified as wildcards can  be
       used to indicate a set of nodes.
