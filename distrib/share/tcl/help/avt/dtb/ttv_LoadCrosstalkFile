DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Loads  a  CTX  file, result of a previous crosstalk analysis, and anno-
       tates a timing figure with crosstalk information such as  delta-delays.
       The  CTX  file should have the same name of the timing figure, with the
       _c_t_x extension. Returns 1 on failure, 0 on success.
