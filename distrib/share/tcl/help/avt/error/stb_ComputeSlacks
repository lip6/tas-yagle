DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Computes  slacks for a combination of data valid path list and required
       path list.
           The data valid path and data required path can be given as a speci-
       fication or directly as a path list.
           A specification is a string containing the arguments to be given to
       the ttv_ProbeDelay API without mentioning the  Timing  Figure  argument
       which  is deduced from the Stability Figure. If "-min" or "-max" is not
       specified in a specification, "-max" for data valid and "-min" for data
       required  is  assumed  for  _b_e_f_o_r_e operation and the opposite for _a_f_t_e_r
       operation.
