       Applyed on the path, indicate to CPE to add a measure to  retreive  the
       delay
           to  VT  of the ending node of _p_t_h which is a command generating the
       event _l_a_t_c_h on the latch.
           The value can be retreived using the corresponding TimingPath prop-
       erty after the simulation
           is done.
