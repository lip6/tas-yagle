#
###############################################################################

# 1 - New functionalities
  - On-line help in avt_shell, type "help help" in avt_shell for details.
  - New API "tmabs", replacement for "tma_abstract" API. This new function
    provides the following advantages:
    + identical configuration for characterization using the HiTAS timing 
      engine or characterization using an external Spice simulator.
    + A common base with the standard path report functions such as 
      ConnectorToLatchMargin and Access Paths which guarantees results
      consistency and allows easy user configuration and results check. 
    + Support for partial characterization, i.e. the user can specify which 
      pins to characterize.
    + Clock-gating checks are reported in the LIB.
    + Setup/Hold constraints relative to generated clocks are handled.
  - New TCL Constraint Objects. Compound object, representing a setup/hold
    timing constraint, made up of the relevant data and clock path components
    together with intrinsic setup/hold. This object is used internally by
    the new "tmabs" and by "ConnectorToLatchMargin". The object also handles
    generated clocks correctly.
  - New properties for timing path object:
     "TYPE", "IS_HZ", "PATH_MARGIN_FACTOR", "PATH_MARGIN_DELTA"
  - New property "IS_ASYNCHRONOUS" for timing signal object.
  - CPE is now capable of calculating simulation patterns for RS loops
    and symmetric memory cells.
  - CPE is now capable of generating simulation measures for HZ paths.
  - Slack reports for user-defined timing checks show details of all slacks
    separated by THRU latch and command and not just the worst case.
    This is the same behaviour as for a normal timing check.
  - Better handling of "counter" style clocking schemes since nodes with
    a generated clock directive are now verified and can be sources of data.
  - M-factor now handled by Spice parser for Instances, Resistors and
    Capacitors as well as Transistors.
  - The automatic false path detection algorithm can now handle access paths.
  - New setting "avtEnableMultipleConnectorsOnNet", which, when set to "yes",
    handles multiple pin connections on a single logical net. This can be 
    useful to avoid disappearance of external pins for a generated LIB file.
    However, this option should not be used unless strictly necessary.
  - New setting "tmaLibDriveTableIndex", which, when set to "yes" means that
    any LIB files are generated with axes specified individually for each
    look-up table instead of being only in the template.

# 2 - Bug fixes
  - Corrected ordering issue in delay recalculation (e.g. ttv_RecomputeDelays)
    which meant some timings were not recalculated.
  - Corrected "set_false_path" matching issue in rare cases where the path
    contained parasitics.

    no timing path reaching the breakpoint.

# 3 - Configuration changes
  - Property "FIGNAME" for object TimingFigure is obsolete, use "NAME"
  
# 4 - Feature changes
  - The effect of a multicycle path directive is now reported in the

    controls across how many transistor the out of path capacitance should
    be counted.
  - Spicedeck generation can now handle certain types of timing loop.

    nodes should be considered to have been precharged for the generation of
    Spicedeck stimuli for memory read.
  - File compression can now be selectively disabled using the setting
    "avtDisableCompression" which is a space separated list of filenames.

    to characterize a transistor even if the transistor was not described as an
    instance.

  - Fixed potential fatal error during crosstalk analysis of circuits without 
    any clock.

    set to yes.
  - The TCL function "ttv_SimulatePathDetail" is deprecated and is replaced by
    the new function "ttv_SimulatePath" which takes a timing path.

    latches are considered to be stuck if all data inputs are stuck even if
    the clock inputs are not stuck.

# 1 - New functionalities
  - Arithmetic on propagated clocks. Using the SDC directive
    "create_generated_clock" it is possible to specify clock
    multipliers/dividers, duty cycle changes, inversion and
    edge_shifting.
  - User defined Setup/Hold timing checks between any two 
    data or clock signals.
  - Automatic detection of clock gating check points.
  - Timing reports contain more detail on type of gate if it
    is a standard CMOS gate.
  - New API function "ttv_DumpHeader" to create a standard header 
    for timing reports.
  - Support for auto-loading of TCL functions defined in the
    distribution TCL directory.
  - Reports of number of warnings/errors at the end of execution
    of any script.
  - Parasitic annotation on diodes and capacitances.
  - Support of spice .connect directive to connect circuit nodes.
  - Full error message documentation.
  - Full support of virtual clocks in data departure/arrival
    specifiations.
  - Support for spice voltage sources with one level of hierarchy.
  - Improved modeling of gate output overshoot.
  - Modeling of local crosstalk effect between input and output
    of a gate.
  - Improved modeling of effective gate input capacitance.
  - Better fitting of transistor characteristics for advanced
    technologies.
  - Improved modeling of current in series connected transistors
    simultaneously switching due to a common input.

# 2 - Bug fixes
  - Improved license management stability.
  - Incorrect master/slave latch markings in case of toggle or
    cascaded flip-flops.
  - "set_case_analysis" timing constraints are now propagated
    through latches. A latch is considered stuck if the data
    is stuck.
  - The timing path characterisation function "ttv_CharacPaths"
    now generates coherent path detail reports.
  - Slew and Load axes for characterisation can now be specified
    per timing figure before loading of the figure.
  - avt_shell no longer blocks when started in the background.
  - Fixed false transistor characterisation warnings for stuck
    nodes.
  - Handling of comments in SPEF parser.
  - Fatal error in case of illegal false path directives.
  - Directive "set_false_path" no longer requires "from" and "to"
    if "through" is specified.
  - Failure of "set_case_analysis" directive when used to specify
    a particular transition on a bussed signal.

# 3 - Configuration changes
  - The setting "tasGenerateDetailTimingFile" is no longer supported.
    The detailed timing file is now always generated, equivalent to 
    the "yes" setting.
  - The setting "tasExitAfterDetailTimingFile" now defaults to "yes".
    The timing path file can be optionally generated by setting this
    variable to "no"
  - The setting "yagAutomaticLatchDetection now defaults to "yes".
  - The setting "yagDetectBistable" is no longer supported. Use the
    setting "yagAutomaticRSDetection" instead. This variable defaults
    to yes but requires "yagAutomaticLatchDetection=yes". By default
    RS bistables are recognised but not treated as latches. This
    behaviour can be customised using "yagAutomaticRSDetection".
  - The settings "tmaTtxInput", "tmaTtxInput", "tmaTtxInput" are 
    no longer supported. The API tma_Abstract automatically uses 
    whatever form of the timing figure has been loaded. If both
    path and detail are loaded, then the detail is used.
  - The settings "avtAnnotationKeepM" and "avtAnnotationKeepX" are
    obsolete. They are replaced by the more general setting
    "avtAnnotationKeepCards"
  - Clocks automatically "Equivalent" if they  are generated from
    the same source clock and have the same period.
