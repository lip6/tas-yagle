# 1 - New functionalities

    "create_generated_clock" it is possible to specify clock

    data or clock signals.
  - Automatic detection of clock gating check points.

    for timing reports.
  - Support for auto-loading of TCL functions defined in the
    distribution TCL directory.
  - Reports of number of warnings/errors at the end of execution
    of any script.
  - Parasitic annotation on diodes and capacitances.
  - Support of spice .connect directive to connect circuit nodes.
  - Full error message documentation.
  - Full support of virtual clocks in data departure/arrival
    specifiations.

  - Incorrect master/slave latch markings in case of toggle or
    cascaded flip-flops.
  - "set_case_analysis" timing constraints are now propagated
    through latches. A latch is considered stuck if the data
    is stuck.
  - The timing path characterisation function "ttv_CharacPaths"
    now generates coherent path detail reports.
  - Slew and Load axes for characterisation can now be specified
    per timing figure before loading of the figure.
  - avt_shell no longer blocks when started in the background.
  - Fixed false transistor characterisation warnings for stuck
    nodes.
  - Handling of comments in SPEF parser.
  - Fatal error in case of illegal false path directives.

    a particular transition on a bussed signal.

# 3 - Configuration changes
  - The setting "tasGenerateDetailTimingFile" is no longer supported.
    The detailed timing file is now always generated, equivalent to 
    the "yes" setting.
  - The setting "tasExitAfterDetailTimingFile" now defaults to "yes".
    The timing path file can be optionally generated by setting this
    variable to "no"
  - The setting "yagAutomaticLatchDetection now defaults to "yes".
  - The setting "yagDetectBistable" is no longer supported. Use the
    setting "yagAutomaticRSDetection" instead. This variable defaults
    to yes but requires "yagAutomaticLatchDetection=yes". By default
    RS bistables are recognised but not treated as latches. This
    behaviour can be customised using "yagAutomaticRSDetection".
  - The settings "tmaTtxInput", "tmaTtxInput", "tmaTtxInput" are 
    no longer supported. The API tma_Abstract automatically uses 
    whatever form of the timing figure has been loaded. If both
    path and detail are loaded, then the detail is used.
  - The settings "avtAnnotationKeepM" and "avtAnnotationKeepX" are
    obsolete. They are replaced by the more general setting
    "avtAnnotationKeepCards"
  - Clocks automatically "Equivalent" if they  are generated from
    the same source clock and have the same period.
