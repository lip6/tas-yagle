\fBetas\fP \- A timing file .dtx and .ttx browser

.so man1/avt_origin.1

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
etas \fI[options] [root_file]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBetas\fP is the browser of the timing result files
provided by the hierarchical timing analyzer \fBtas\fP.
It requires a file with the \fBttx\fP extension 
to report information on the path delays and possibly
a file with the \fBdtx\fP extension to report information on the detailed delays (gate)
of the paths.
.PP
\fBetas\fP reports timing information selected according to
the user's requests.
When entering \fBetas\fP, the prompt \fBetas\fP appears. 
On-line help can be provided by running:
.PP
\fBetas>\fP  help [options|commands|arguments]
.PP 
the options should be specified when running \fBetas\fP, they are described
in the following section.
The commands and the arguments are specified after entering \fBetas\fP. 
They are described in the following sections.
Previously performed commands are available through the keyboard arrow.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options may appear in any order before or after the
input filename.

.TP 10
\fI-in="ref_in"\fP
Active with the \fBpath\fP command.
It can be cancelled by the \fBnoin\fP command.
Very useful for large circuits and clock checking.
When this option is set \fBetas\fP reports
only the critical \fBpath\fP associated
to the \fIref_in\fP signal. The \fIref_in\fP signal
can either be :
.br
        -a register (or latch), or
.br
        -an input terminal, or
.br
        -a bidirectional terminal.
.br
It is possible to specify more than one signal by using
\fIregular expression\fP containing
as many '*' as you want. You can ask for a part of a vectorized signal
(for example \fI-xin="sig*a*" -xin="vector[2-5]\fP").

.TP 10
\fI-lm=value\fP
This option enables the user to indicate the maximum size of the cache memory to be used
by \fBetas\fP (Megabyte) when loading the timing data base
resulting from \fBtas\fP run.
During the analysis \fBetas\fP tries to use less than \fBlm\fP megabytes,
if it does not succeed \fBetas\fP uses more and issues a warning.
\fBetas\fP will allow 10% of the cache memory to the signals and 90% to the paths.
This size can be modified by the \fBcache\fP command.

.TP 10
\fI-name="signal"\fP
This option enables the user to specify the name of signals (terminals, latches, other signals)
that
will be reported by the \fBlist\fP command.
It is possible to specify more than one signal by using
\fIregular expression\fP containing
as many '*' as you want. You can ask for a part of a vectorized signal
(for example \fI-xout="sig*a*" -xout="vector[2-5]\fP").

.TP 10
\fI-out="ref_out"\fP
Active with the \fBpath\fP command.
It can be cancelled by the \fBnoout\fP command.
Very useful for large circuits.
When this option is set \fBetas\fP reports
only the critical path associated
to the \fIref_out\fP signal. The \fIref_out\fP signal
can either be :
.br
        -a register (or latch), or
.br
        -a register command, or
.br
        -an output terminal, or
.br
        -a bidirectional terminal.
.br
It is possible to specify more than one signal by using
\fIregular expression\fP containing
as many '*' as you want. You can ask for a part of a vectorized signal
(for example \fI-xout="sig*a*" -xout="vector[2-5]\fP").

.TP 10
\fI-x[=val_min][=:val_max][=val_min:val_max]\fP
If the \fB-x\fP option is used  without argument, the
details of \fBall\fP  critical paths will be reported.
Beware that this can be a lot of informations.
With \fI=val_min\fP  argument, where \fIval_min\fP is a delay in pico-second
(integer), only paths with delay greater than \fIval_min\fP will be
detailed.
With \fI=:val_max\fP  argument, where \fIval_max\fP is a delay in pico-second
(integer), only paths with delay smaller than \fIval_max\fP will be
detailed.
With \fI=val_min:val_max\fP argument, only paths with delay between
\fIval_min\fP and
\fIval_max\fP will be detailed.

.TP 10
\fI-w=integer\fP
Specify the maximum number of delays or signals to be reported
simultaneously.



.SH COMMAND
.PP
The commands allow the user to request a report on some specified timing data.
You run the commands by :

.br
\fBetas>\fP  command_name [command_parameter] [command_argument]

On-line help can be provided by running:

.br
\fBetas>\fP  help command 

If an arrow follows the name of the command, further information
can be retrieved by :

.br
\fBetas>\fP help command command_name


.TP 10
\f4list(l) list_parameter [list_argument]\fP 
request  a list of items \fBlist_parameter\fP
in the circuit (instance, command, terminal, latch or
precharged signal). The \fBlist_parameter\fP
allow the user to specify the type of items of the requested list. They are:
.br
	\f4instance(i)\fP : report the list of instances
.br
	\f4command(q)\fP : report the list of commands (of memory points)
.br
	\f4connector(c)\fP : report the list of terminals
.br
	\f4latch(l)\fP : report the list of latches
.br
	\f4precharge(p)\fP : report the list of precharged signals
.br
	\f4signal(s)\fP : report the other kind of signals

.TP 10
\f4path(p) path_parameter [path_argument]\fP 
request for path search according to \fBpath_parameter\fP
(delay, critic or parallel). The \fBpath_parameter\fP 
allow the user to
specify the type of path report requested. They are:
.br
	\f4delay(d)\fP : report all the critical paths (possibly specified by the \fBpath_argument\fP)
.br
	\f4critic(c)\fP : report only the longest (or shortest) critical path
.br
	\f4parallel(p)\fP : report the parallel paths of a specified path (use \fBpath_argument\fP)
.br
NB. The \f4critic\fP \fPpath_parameter\fP can be used to report more than
one path. You can use :
.br
\f4path critic number\fP to specify the number (integer) of longest (or shortest) paths to 
be reported
.br
\f4path critic delaymax=value1 delaymin=value2\fP to specify the time interval
between value1 (pisosecond) and value2 (picosecond), 
in which you want the paths to be reported.




.TP 10
\f4detail(d) detail_parameter [detail_argument]\fP 
request for detailed delay search according to
\fBdetail_parameter\fP (delay, critic or parallel). The \fBdetail_parameter\fP
allow the user to
specify the type of detailed report requested.
The path can be specified by an index. This index is available in the
path report, so a path report should be performed before the request on details.
This option requires the existence of the \fB.dtx\fP file.
The \fBdetail_parameter\fP are:
.br
	\f4delay(d)\fP : report the detailed (gate) delays of a specified path (use \fBdetail_argument\fP)
.br

\fBdetail_argument\fP)

.TP 10
\f4open(o) file_name\fP

file_name.dtx), the file_name should be given without extension

.TP 10

default value is 10

.TP 10
\f4cache(c) int1 [int2]\fP 
set the value (Megabyte) of the cache size 
to be used for loading the timing data. Without the value argument \fBetas\fP reports
the actual size of the cache. With only one argument (\fBint1\fP integer)  \fBetas\fP
uses 10% of the cache memory for signals and 90% for paths. With both arguments
(integers) \fBetas\fP uses the value \fBint1\fP for the signals and \fBint2\fP
for the paths.
