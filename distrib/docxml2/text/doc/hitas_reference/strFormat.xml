<section niv='2'><title>STR - STA Report Format</title>

<p>For most users, this is the most important file generated by &tool;. It has the suffix <f>.str</f> and a 
base name identical to that of the original subcircuit. It lists the setup and hold slacks calculated for all 
reference points. This includes:</p>
<list>
<item>Output connectors</item>
<item>Memory signals</item>
<item>Conditioned memory commands</item>
<item>Precharged signals</item>
</list>
<p>All memory and conditioned commands are specified with the details of propagated clock, since this is the reference for the setup and hold calculations.</p>
<p>A negative value for a setup or hold slack indicates a violation. In the event of a violation on a particular signal, all data sources resulting in a violation are listed for that signal, together with their individual setup and hold slacks.</p>
