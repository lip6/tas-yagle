<p>This tutorial describes the use of &tool; Static Timing Analysis and Signal Integrity Analysis platform. The main purpose of this tutorial is to show the ability of the HiTAS platform to analyze designs at transistor level.</p>
<p>This tutorial explains how to set-up a complete Timing and SI verification flow for each component of the design, and then for the top-level. The verification flow includes the following steps:</p>
<list>
<item>Build a homogeneous database for each component</item>
<item>Perform a first analysis of timing paths</item>
<item>Integrate interface constraints</item>
<item>Perform Timing Constraint checks (setup/hold)</item>
<item>Perform a SI analysis</item>
<!-- <item>Generate an abstracted model of the top-level</item> -->
</list>
<p>The verification process is detailed in the following diagram:</p>
