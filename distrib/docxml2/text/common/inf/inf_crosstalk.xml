<p>During the aggression detection stage, it is possible to specify that only one signal can switch at the same time among a set of signals. Theses sets are specified in CROSSTALK MUTEX section :</p>
<code>
<cl>CROSSTALK MUTEX</cl>
<cl>BEGIN</cl>
<cl>    MUXUP {sig1, sig2};</cl>
<cl>    MUXDN {sig3, sig4, sig5};</cl>
<cl>    MUXUP {sig7, sig8, ..., sig12};</cl>
<cl>    ...;</cl>
<cl>END;</cl>
</code>
<p>
In each MUXUP (MUXDN) section, only one signal in the list can rise (fall) at the same time. 
A signal can be listed at most in one MUXUP and in one MUXDN section. If two or more signals of a same mutex 
appear in the aggressor list of a signal, the one with the bigger coupling capacitance between 
the victim and this aggressor is considered to be switching at the same time.</p>
