<section niv='2'><title>Netlist Format</title>

<p>The format for the transistor netlist is a standard flat spice subcircuit contained in a single file. However, a number of special extensions are recognised. These are accomodated as spice comments, lines commencing with an asterisk. The asterisk is followed by a space and one of the following directives, together with parameters (non case-sensitive)</p>
<p>The directive:</p>
<code>nettype &lt;index&gt; &lt;typemask&gt;</code>
<p>Associates the types indicated in &lt;typemask&gt; to any signal in the main circuit corresponding to the signal in the searched for netlist identified by &lt;index&gt;.</p>
<p>Predefined types are:</p>
<glossary>
<ro type='split'w><article>NET_LATCH</article><def>Signal corresponds to a latch memory-point.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>NET_FLIPFLOP</article><def>Signal corresponds to a flip-flop memory-point.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>NET_MASTER</article><def>Signal corresponds to the master memory-point of a flip-flop.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>NET_SLAVE</article><def>Signal corresponds to the slave memory-point of a flip-flop.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>NET_MEMSYM</article><def>Signal corresponds to one side of a symmetric memory.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>NET_RS</article><def>Signal corresponds to one side of an RS bistable.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>NET_VDD</article><def>Signal corresponds to an alimentation.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>NET_VSS</article><def>Signal corresponds to ground.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>NET_BLOCKER</article><def>No branch of a cone (see man &MIN;) can go through the signal.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>NET_STOP</article><def>Cannot exploit logic beyond this point for functional analysis in the disassembler. </def></row>
<row type='split'><article>NET_BYPASS</article><def>Signal cannot appear in a timing path. </def></row>
<row type='split'><article>NET_MATCHNAME</article><def>The signal is only matched if the name in the pattern to recognize and the name in the source netlist are identical.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>NET_SENSITIVE</article><def>Marks the signal as a particularly sensitive signal. If a timed behavioral model of this signal is produced then the most precise (but cumbersome) model will be generated.</def></row>
</glossary>
<p>The directive:</p>
<code>transtype &lt;name&gt; &lt;typemask&gt;</code>
<p>Associates the types indicated in &lt;typemask&gt; to any transistor in the main circuit corresponding to the transistor in the searched for netlist identified by &lt;name&gt;. Predefined types are:</p>
<glossary>
<row type='split'><article>TRANS_BLEEDER</article><def>Transistor corresponds to a bleeder.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>TRANS_FEEDBACK</article><def>Transistor corresponds to a feedback transistor of a memory-point.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>TRANS_COMMAND</article><def>Transistor corresponds to a command transistor of a memory-point, i.e driven by command signal.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>TRANS_NOT_FUNCTIONAL</article><def>Transistor should be ignored when calculating gate functionality.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>TRANS_BLOCKER</article><def>No branch of a cone  can contain this transistor unless it is the first transistor of the branch.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>TRANS_UNUSED</article><def>No branch of a cone can contain this transistor.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>TRANS_SHORT</article><def>The transistor is considered short-circuited, the gate signal no longer contributes to the list of inputs.</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>TRANS_MATCHSIZE</article><def>The transistor is only matched if the dimensions correspond exactly or to within a given tolerance (see FCL configuration).</def></row>
<row type='split'><article>TRANS_SHARE</article><def>The transistor can be matched by several patterns.</def></row>
</glossary>
<p>The &lt;typemask&gt; parameter is made up of a list of one or more of the predefined types, separated by the vertical bar '|' character. Directives should be included within the .SUBCKT and .ENDS spice statements.</p>
<p>The directive:</p>
<code>cmpup &lt;name&gt; ... &lt;name&gt;</code>
<p> is a mutual exclusion directive indicating that one and only one of the signals or ports can be at logic one.</p>
<p>The directive:</p>
<code>cmpdn &lt;name&gt; ... &lt;name&gt;</code>
<p> is a mutual exclusion directive indicating that one and only one of the signals or ports can be at logic zero.</p>
<p>The directive:</p>
<code>muxup &lt;name&gt; ... &lt;name&gt;</code>
<p> is a mutual exclusion directive indicating that at most one of the signals or ports can be at logic one.</p>
<p>The directive:</p>
<code>muxdn &lt;name&gt; ... &lt;name&gt;</code>
<p> is a mutual exclusion directive indicating that at most one of the signals or ports can be at logic zero.</p>
<p>The directive:</p> 
<code>netoutput &lt;name&gt; [level]</code>
<p>allows the user to orient transistors, by associating a level with a signal identifying
the drain or source terminal of a transistor. If no level is specified, the level is implicitely 1.
Transistors are then oriented from higher level signals or standard signals to
lower level signals. This directive is usefull to avoid false branch construction, especially
when dealing with pass-transistors.</p>
<p>The netoutput directive acts in the same way as the DIROUT directive in the information file.</p>
