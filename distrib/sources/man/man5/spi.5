.SH NAME

spi \- parser for Spice netlist.

.so man1/avt_origin.1

.SH FILES

The description of a netlist foo must be contained  in a \fB.SUBCKT\fP of a file named \fIfoo.spi\fP. This description can include others \fB.SUBCKT\fP that must be in the same file or files included with the command \fB.INCLUDE\fP in the source file.

Recognized elements are :

.RS
Resistances

Capacitances

Instances

MOS  transistors.

.RE
Others elements are not considered.

Nodes can be either numbered or nameed. It's possible to assign a name to a node which is designated by a number with the directive

.B * NET number = name

in the \fB.SUBCKT\fP. The word NET can be replaced by positioning the environment variable \fIMBK_SPI_NETNAME\fP. Names are used to named the signals and the connectors in the model.

On the \fB.SUBCKT\fP interface, nodes of the same name followed by a period and a number are considered to be on the net, even if no connected in the circuit. For example :

.RS
 .SUBCKT nand2 in out out.1 out.2 vss vdd out.3
.RE

The nodes out, out.1, out.2 and out.3 are considered to be the same signal of the spice model. This feature can be turned off if the environment variable \fIMBK_SPI_MERGE\fP is set, and the period can be replaced by another character with the environment variable \fIMBK_SPI_SEPAR\fP.

No particular information is needed to build a model from a \fB.SUBCKT\fP, the parser rebuild all signals, even they contains many resistances and capacitances. If names are not provided, the parser will create then in order to provide a valid model.

.SH PARSER

The parser load all \fB.SUBCKT\fP in memory, even those in files included with the command \fB.INCLUDE\fP until the required model is loaded. For each \fB.SUBCKT\fP loaded, the parser build the equipotentials with both nodes of resistances on the same net and both nodes of capacitances on differents net unless more information is given.

Environment variable considered are

.RS
.B MBK_SPI_TN

.B MBK_SPI_TP

.B MBK_SPI_NETNAME

.B MBK_SPI_SEPAR

.B MBK_SPI_MERGE

.B MBK_SPI_FILE
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.B MBK_SPI_TP

.B MBK_SPI_TN

Transistor model name. Multiple names may be concatened using the character ':'. Default names are 
.I tp
and
.I tn

.B MBK_SPI_NETNAME

Comment used to name the nodes. Default is
.I NET.

.B MBK_SPI_SEPAR

Character used to separate a name from a node number on the interface of the \fB.SUBCKT\fP. The parser considers nodes of the same name to be on the same equipotential. Default is '\fB.\fP'.

.B MBK_SPI_MERGE

If this variable is set, the parser does not merge interface nodes of the same name, but different number, on the same equipotential.

.B MBK_SPI_FILE

If this variable is set, the name of the files opened are displayed on the error output.

.SH EXAMPLE

This is an example of a file used by the Spice parser.
